# UK Carpentry Community Meetings - Notes

This is the UK Carpentry Community space:
- for the UK Carpentry instructors, helpers and workshop coordinators (or anyone involved in training tech to researchers in general and outside of the UK) to get to know each other better and encourage collaboration
- to get the community's questions answered and provide help with technical aspects of creating Carpentry workshop websites, registering workshops with the Carpentries, Carpentry institutional membership or anything else 
- to help the community in the UK with organising workshops and finding instructors/helpers
- to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for the community to share their experience, explore topics of interest, find collaborators for training related projects and network.

During these meetings, we will be conforming to [The Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).

**Regular calls: 4th Monday of the month, 16:00-17:00 UK time - at the moment GMT (UTC) but we will observe the daytime saving switch to BST**

**Meeting details are shared via [local-uk mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/local-uk) and [The Carpentries community calendar](https://carpentries.org/community/#community-events).**

    - Giacomo: Same time Friday this week :-) I second this (Lucia)
    - Mario: volcanic eruption near Reykjakvik looks interesting, so there!

    - Shashank: Outside; it's sunny enough in Leeds.
    - Callum: Kayaking on the river
    - Alex: to see family outside the UK
    - Toby: If I could take my family with me, I would teleport to the UK so our son could see his grandparents and uncles (and we would stand more chance of getting a Covid vaccine some time soon!). I would also want to be able to teleport away again!
    - Joni: Like to go and watch the SpaceX Starship development
    - James: Middle of the lake district after COVID with directions to the nearest decent pub [name=Toby]: this sounds great too

        - third day is Hack Day - get into teams and maybe earn some prizes!
    - [Virtual Event Grants](https://eventfund.codeforscience.org/request-for-proposals/) - dealine 29th March 2021
    - GLAM (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, Museums) Data Science Network starting to get going: please retweet the [poll about domain names](https://twitter.com/jezcope/status/1374017661613531136) to help raise awareness (and vote yourself...); more information on new website at <https://glam-datasci.netlify.app>; thanks! ‚Äî [name=Jez]
        - Also looking for volunteers to help organise a kick-off workshop

4. Guest speaker: Giacomo Peru from EdCarp (Edinburgh Carpentries community) + Q&A (20 minutes)
    -  a bit of history, how it all started
        -  it was helped by the fact that the SSI has a branch in Edinburgh and there was a lot of know-how available in the Institute
    -  website: https://edcarp.github.io/workshops/
    -  how you got the funds/effort initially
        -  no money initially, but there was the opportunity for Giacomo to put in 20-40% of his time to support Carpentries activities
        -  Sean McGeaver, School of Physics and Astronomy, UoE, put in some money in to pay the first membership with the Carpentries from his grant (the first year), then got other 3 colleges in Edinburgh to chip in
        -  set up one [Organising Committee and one Steering Committee](https://edcarp.github.io/committee/)
            -  Steering Committee meets twice per year, composed of people who (in theory) are able to commit funds and resources.
        -  Mario: uptake from different areas, effort from representives at different schools/faculties was vital to get it going. It began with interest in learning the skills taught in a Carpentries workshop, then became interested in becoming an Instructor.
            -  Lucia: volunteer-based model assumes Instructors will be staff who can dedicate time as part of their job. But often not the case, and e.g. PhD students can feel pressured to take on voluntary teaching responsibilities without potential for this effort to be rewarded.
    -  how are you funded now
        -  even now it is not easy to get agreement on supporting a membership
        -  we have been able to attract small pots of money to spend on specific projects (e.g. Scottish Funding Council last year for 7 workshops)
        -  EdCarp are also now part of a funded UKRI project to develop materials for bioinformatics training & deliver workshops
            -  also allows us to pay for maintenance and development of infrastructure e.g. website
    -  where are you based (which group within the Uni of Edinburgh)
    -  how many people are there in the community altogether, how many are involved in training
    -  are you a Carpentry partner and how do you find the money for that and how do you justify that to your funders,
    -  what are the terms of your Carpentry partnership?
    -  are you mainly self-sufficient now in terms of workshop organisations,
    -  how long it took EdCarp to become self-sufficient?
        -  not sure we are yet! even though there is huge interest and potential, we would not exist without leadership. Essential to have this dedicated leadership. 
            -  Aleks: :+1: in Manchester we see the services of members of the community are becoming over-subscribed and, without support from the top, they are going to struggle to keep doing this stuff voluntarily.
            -  Giacomo: it would be great to hear from anyone who has experience with convincing Universities etc to support these kinds of activity
    -  How does EdinCarp sit alongside any other university-wide bodies at Edinburgh? Do you have centralised IT, research support or library, or is that all contained within each of your three colleges? Do you stand on anyone's toes?
        -  There are central IT and Library services, but (some?) schools have their own IT too
        - Everybody at Edi is happy that EdCarp is doing what they are doing
        - EPCC is full of people who are full of people competent to teach these courses
        - In terms of competition - efforts to establish a local RSE group was not as successful as the EdCarp  
    - David PS: UCL: RSE team organises them. We try to find volunteers within "our community" for instructors and helpers. If not, the people from our team jumps in.
    -  Are other Edinburgh universities, ICMS (International Centre for Mathematical Sciences) and other organisations beyond the University of Edinburgh involved?
        -  yes. EdCarp is a collaboration between various institutions in the area, e.g. HWU, 
        -  no central support from any of the institutions - we have access to the resources of our respective institutes.
   - [x] Do you get many requests about more advanced material? If so, do you point them or run other workshops like [coderefinery](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/)? something else?
     - The SSI is organising something more advanced. Though Greg Wilson comments at CarpentryCon is that such gap should be covered by another type of training (e.g., University training)

6. Workshop organisation process go-through/recap + Q&A (15 minutes) (if there is time, if not - we will leave this for next time)
    - workshop slug/id
    - finding instructors/helpers
        - [instructor sign-up form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YhTAzEalDqKUowgej7aRa7E1K0XcB6ZezoVUt6VN2qY/edit#gid=266374636)
        - announce on [UK carpentry mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/local-uk) and [international instructor mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors)
    - can you pay the training team?
    - [register your workshop with The Carpentires](https://amy.carpentries.org/forms/self-organised/)
    - why is my workhop not listed at the Carpentries website
    - [Carpentries workshop FAQ](https://carpentries.org/workshop_faq/)
        - timeline - so you get workshop survey results on time
    
    **Question**: the most recent post in UK topic box for [carpentries workshop signups](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/local-uk/Tfece4de45672183f) links to a Google doc, all of the workshops are in the US. Is there a list of all the UK workshops? (Callum)
    - Have a look at the pages of the spreadsheet (tabs at the bottom) (Shashank) Thanks! Possily hang such a page off the existing Carpentry pages as opposed to reinventing the wheel.
    If the link were to the [UK tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YhTAzEalDqKUowgej7aRa7E1K0XcB6ZezoVUt6VN2qY/edit#gid=266374636) this could prevent confusion.
    
    **Question**: How many UK institutions are carpentries members? Has anybody got any examples of what it took to join/how it was funded or even examples of attempts which failed?
    - [Members of The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/members/)
        
7. AOB
- Comment on localised data for the UK from Malvika: Can the Carpentries member orgs maintain some sort of Git page that hosts these details (update workshop dates, and members etc.)?
    - Why would we need this? Help with impact and help institutions how to learn their memberships. 
    - Why would we need this? Help with impact and help institutions how to learn their memberships. 
    - Mario: Map of member institutions would be a nice idea
    - David PS: map of member institutions with a time slider, so you can see how they change ;)
        - Malvika: Collaboration Workshop Hack Day idea!
    - David PS: query the wikipedia to get the coordinates of the institution, pass it to open street map to visualise little classic building emojis on these. Don't forget the readme, license, howtocollaborate, and the CoC on the repo! and you've got a winning project ;)

- House keeping 
    - Rolling notes - this document!
    - After each session, the notes will be stored in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/anenadic/local-uk/blob/main/meeting_minutes.md) (hopefully with a push of a button)
    - **Rotating roles - setting the agenda, chairing and notetaking**
    - Meetings will appear in the [Carpentries community calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/embed?src=oseuuoht0tvjbokgg3noh8c47g@group.calendar.google.com)
    - This notes document is also linked from the top of the [Carpentries community discussion Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions) 
- What do you personally / or the community as a whole want from these calls? So that it can help us with planning the themes of the future calls. (Make your suggestions here.)
    - e.g. workshop organisation - the process and what people need help with? 
    - look for lesson developers and maintainers [name=Phil Reed]
    - opportunities to instruct +2 [name=Flic Anderson](@gjblyth Graham Blyth)  Join the instructor mailing list here : https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/instructors. New opportunities for instructors go out weekly :)
    - opportunities to join as helper +1 [name=Flic Anderson] (@gjblyth Graham Blyth)
    - cross connections between lessons?  Discussion on strategy perhaps.  It would be duplication of effort to rewrite lessons for each domain though.  Emphasising cross connections perhaps instead? [name=Joni Pelham] +1
      - looking for ways to have the domain selectable without changing the entire course would help. HPC Carpentry has (sort of) done this by allowing you to select which HPC system is being used and all the instructions update to be specific to that. [name=Colin Sauze]
      - some "modularity" of materials perhaps, so we can mix-and-match to organise workshops around a theme? [name=Hugo T]
    - Katerina: organise joint remote workshops? +1
    - Mario: et to know fellow members in the community, easier to populate courses with helpers/instructors if you know the faces. Something I would love to know is evaluating the efficacy of courses - get back to attendees later and ask them whether they went on to use what they learnt, any pitfalls they encountered or whether they were there because they were told to be or just for interest. +1Share best practice - what works/does not work. +1
    - +1 to above on evaluation, doing more about long term evaluation would be really useful to justify resources.
    - invite past learners to join regional community as helpers (and hopefully as instructors)     +2
    - chances to run/help with workshops at other universities. Especially while geography doesn't matter so much! +5 [name=Colin Sauze, Flic Anderson, ....]
    - Meet people around the UK who are involved in the Carpentries. Looking forward to organising workshops around the UK. If you want to volunteer as a helper or instructor, feel free to contact me. [name=Juan Herrera]
    - Keep up to date with what's happening in the community, who's working on what, who wants help with what, where the British Library can facilitate (especially Library Carpentry) [name=Jez Cope]
    - How to promote library carpentry? learning from other universities. How librarians can put learning into practise / day-to-day job facilitate (especially Library Carpentry) [name=Nilani Ganeshwaran]+1
    - Ideas for bridging carpentries and digital scholarship [name=Nilani Ganeshwaran] +1
    
- Q&A - what questions do you have?
    - Anyone interested in teaching the R class (13th of May) from the Lib Carp Curriculum? (lucia.michielin@ed.ac.uk)
    - Also looking for helpers for [Software Carpentry March 9-12](http://rits.github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/2021-03-09_UCL_software_carpentry/) at UCL! (remotely though) (a.georgoulas@ucl.ac.uk)
- Announcements
    - Subscribe to or check regularly the [Carpentries Blog](https://carpentries.org/blog/).
- Suggestions
    - Mario: Break up into smaller special interest groups who work on a task/topic on a voluntary task and report back at the next meeting.
- Regular calls
    - Frequency and time?
        - e.g. monthly, forth week of the month?
    - Another Doodle poll to set the date?
