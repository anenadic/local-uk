# UK Carpentry Community (local-uk)
This is repository to backup the minutes from the [UK Carpentry Community calls on HackMD](https://hackmd.io/V3ReKkEESzqyCNxWJdulOw). 

The calls are:
- for the UK Carpentry instructors, helpers and workshop coordinators (or anyone involved in training tech to researchers in general and outside of the UK) to get to know each other better and encourage collaboration
- to get the communityâ€™s questions answered and provide help with technical aspects of creating Carpenry workshop websites, registering workshops with the Carpentries, Carpentry - institutional membership or anything else
- to help the community in the UK with organising workshops and finding instructors/helpers
- to provide a welcoming and inclusive environment for the community to share their experience, explore topics of interest, find collaborators for training related projects and network.
